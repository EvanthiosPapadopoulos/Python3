## Methods and Functions, solutions

Problems are arranged in increasing difficulty:

*Warmup - these can be solved using basic comparisons and methods
*Level 1 - these may involve if/then conditional statements and simple methods
*Level 2 - these may require iterating over sequences, usually with some kind of loop
*Challenging - these will take some creativity to solve

###WARMUP SECTION:
####LESSER OF TWO EVENS: Write a function that returns the lesser of two given numbers if both numbers are even, but returns the greater if one or both numbers are odd

####ANIMAL CRACKERS: Write a function takes a two-word string and returns True if both words begin with same letterÂ¶

####MAKES TWENTY: Given two integers, return True if the sum of the integers is 20 or if one of the integers is 20. If not, return False

####OLD MACDONALD: Write a function that capitalizes the first and fourth letters of a name

####MASTER YODA: Given a sentence, return a sentence with the words reversed

####ALMOST THERE: Given an integer n, return True if n is within 10 of either 100 or 200
