## Methods and Functions, solutions

Problems are arranged in increasing difficulty:

* Warmup - these can be solved using basic comparisons and methods
* Level 1 - these may involve if/then conditional statements and simple methods
* Level 2 - these may require iterating over sequences, usually with some kind of loop
* Challenging - these will take some creativity to solve

## WARMUP SECTION:
#### LESSER OF TWO EVENS: Write a function that returns the lesser of two given numbers if both numbers are even, but returns the greater if one or both numbers are odd

#### ANIMAL CRACKERS: Write a function takes a two-word string and returns True if both words begin with same letterÂ¶

#### MAKES TWENTY: Given two integers, return True if the sum of the integers is 20 or if one of the integers is 20. If not, return False

### LEVEL 1 PROBLEMS

#### OLD MACDONALD: Write a function that capitalizes the first and fourth letters of a name

#### MASTER YODA: Given a sentence, return a sentence with the words reversed

#### ALMOST THERE: Given an integer n, return True if n is within 10 of either 100 or 200

### LEVEL 2 PROBLEMS

#### FIND 33

#### PAPER DOLL: Given a string, return a string where for every character in the original there are three characters

#### BLACKJACK: Given three integers between 1 and 11, if their sum is less than or equal to 21, return their sum. If their sum exceeds 21 and there's an eleven, reduce the total sum by 10. Finally, if the sum (even after adjustment) exceeds 21, return 'BUST'

#### SUMMER OF '69: Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and extending to the next 9 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 9). Return 0 for no numbers.

### CHALLENGING PROBLEMS

#### SPY GAME: Write a function that takes in a list of integers and returns True if it contains 007 in order

#### COUNT PRIMES: Write a function that returns the number of prime numbers that exist up to and including a given number

#### PRINT BIG: Write a function that takes in a single letter, and returns a 5x5 representation of that letter
